        <p class="lead"> Welcome to my home page. My name is Luis Chavez and I am a full time student at CSULB. I graduted from Garden Grove High School in 2020 and this is my first year attending CSULB. I was put on the waitlist and managed to get out of the waitlist for CSULB. I am currently in Pre-Computer Engineering and am hoping to declare after next semester. I am aiming to get a Bachelor's Degree for Computer Engineering by Fall 2023 if everything goes according to plan. Some hobbies that I have consists of playing games, watching anime, hanging out with friends, and playing paintball. My family consits of 4 people which include my mom, older brother, younger brother and me. Some goals that I have are to find a job in the computer engineering field because I don't want to be underemployed.


	I also want to go travel the world and visit different countries. Aside from that I am excited for summer because I will getting a long deserved break and I will be able to fix my sleep schedule since I keep sleeping at midnight or around 2am. </p>
